# My First React App

Just putting this up in github as backup and for future reference.

**Taken from Chris Blakely's [article on freecodecamp][1].**

I think its's a really cool introductory tutorial that uses an API to get random data and then display them in a nice layout.

I also used [this Medium article][2] for hosting this on Github.
